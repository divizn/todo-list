<h1 align="center">Todo List Web App</h1>

<p align="center">This is my first attempt at creating a full stack application and I decided to start with the popular todo list.</p>

<p align="center">Currently, it allows you to add items to the list using the React frontend and is then stored in my MySQL database (currently only have POST and GET RESTful methods in Java)</p>
